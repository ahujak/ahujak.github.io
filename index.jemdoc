== About
I am an AI Resident at [https://www.research.ibm.com/ IBM Research, Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY]. Before coming to IBM, I completed my PhD in [https://www.ee.ucla.edu Electrical and Computer Engineering] from [https://www.ucla.edu University of California, Los Angeles] and B.tech-M.tech Dual Degree in [https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee Electrical Engineering] from [https://www.iitk.ac.in/ Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur].



I am interested in problems that lie at some intersection (sometimes even union!) of optimization, machine learning, and game theory.  Over the years, I have worked on  developing tractable and approximate (sometimes provable!) optimization algorithms for resource allocation problems and different problems in machine learning. More recently, I have been fascinated by problems related to out-of-distribution generalization and robust machine learning algorithms.
