== About
I am a Research Scientist at FAIR (Meta AI). Prior to joining FAIR, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Mila – Quebec AI Institute, where I worked under the guidance of Yoshua Bengio, Irina Rish, and Ioannis Mitliagkas. I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, and a B.Tech–M.Tech Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I also spent a year at IBM Research, Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY, as an AI Resident in the Trustworthy AI team led by Kush Varshney.

My research spans machine learning, causality, and optimization. I am particularly interested in questions around generalization in machine learning, especially generalization beyond the training distribution. In the post-LLM era, I find it especially intriguing to explore how large language models generalize—and the conditions under which they fail to do so.

In earlier work, I also focused on optimization methods for resource allocation problems.
