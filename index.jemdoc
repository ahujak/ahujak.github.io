== About
I am a postdoctoral fellow at Mila-Quebec AI Institute. Before joining Mila I was an AI Resident at [https://www.research.ibm.com/ IBM Research, Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY]. Before coming to IBM, I completed my PhD in [https://www.ee.ucla.edu Electrical and Computer Engineering] from [https://www.ucla.edu University of California, Los Angeles] and B.tech-M.tech Dual Degree in [https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee Electrical Engineering] from [https://www.iitk.ac.in/ Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur].



I am broadly interested in problems in the areas of  machine learning, causality, and optimization. In the past, I  worked on optimization methods for  resource allocation problems. In recent years, I have worked on the theory and methods for  out-of-distribution generalization in machine learning.
